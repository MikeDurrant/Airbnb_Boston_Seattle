# Airbnb_Boston_Seattle
My coursework work as part of my Udacity Data Science nanodegree


## Introduction

Following the CRISP-DM process, from understanding a real business problem and understanding the data, through to communicating and visualising insights from the whole exercise, this Github repository contains all the code and data files required to replicate the analysis behind my Medium blog post (https://mikedurrantsheffield.medium.com/a-data-tale-of-two-cities-that-will-make-you-a-better-airbnb-host-48a154b911ee).

The data science steps of 'gather', 'assess', 'clean', 'analyze', 'model', 'visualize' are clearly labelled in the enclosed Jupyter notebook.
